My company would give jobs to the community. People would help serve the community like picking up trash or providing resources for the community, throwing events every week with influencers that impacts or have impacted the community. This would not be profitable but if others see us they can invest and help us spread.

Entrepreneurship is making a business by yourself 
Uber interacts with my communities by providing rides for us making sure of safety
RSE mindset maximises success with constant change adapting to flaws and focusing on improvement
I want to focus on recognizing the problems like financial, resources, domestic, to try and fix them
